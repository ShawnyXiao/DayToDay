# Mist DApp Browser

Mist is the browser for decentralized web apps. What Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome are for the Web 2.0, the Mist Browser will be for the Web 3.0 (which will be decentralized).

Mist is still in heavy development. And there is only one open release available yet, which is 0.3.6, the secret open source release. This release allows you to open any Ethereum DApp with the Mist Browser.

# Ethereum Wallet DApp

All other releases of 'Mist' are no Mist releases at all, but a bundle of Mist Browser with a single DApp: The Ethereum Wallet, also known as the Meteor DApp Wallet.

These releases are therefore called Ethereum Wallet as it only offers a bundle of the Mist browser with a single DApp: the wallet.

The future, with Metropolis release, will provide a full Mist Browser able to open any DApp available out there. The Ethereum wallet will only be one among them.
