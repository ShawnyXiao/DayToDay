# DayToDay
The inspiration of the name of this repository comes from a song, which has the same name. This repository just recodes what I learned everyday and pushes myself to learn something.

## Casual topic
- 2016-10-11 : My tutor leaves three papers for me, which has topics about app recommendation and reliability of web service system. These three guys maybe would consume some time. After reading, I would left these papers and its reading notes, which would display the key of papers and my ideas.
- 2016-10-14 : Recently, I start to learn machine learning by myself. So some fragmented knowledge points would be shown here, where I just wanna enhance my memory.
- 2016-10-18 : After watching some course video, it's surprising for me that many foreigner students dare to ask questions and are good at asking questions. I think that is so cool! This ability is what I want at this stage.
- 2016-10-23 : Just take a look around REST and RESTful API (a digression from the topic of machine learning, haaaaa).
